# JUST BEFORE

#### üé• Video demo: <https://youtu.be/P3UCjQ5IDXU>

Just Before is a web-based application that keep track of product expiration dates to minimize food waste.

## Idea and objectives
The primary objective of this project was to design a tool that people could avail of every day. 
Monitoring my family‚Äôs lifestyle, one of the main issues to face is food waste. Unfortunately, it is common to just throw away food because it has gone bad, without people even remembering they had bought it. 

Research confirmed my suspicion: food waste is widespread in every part of the world, especially in wealthier and developing countries, with significant environmental and social consequences. Thus, it‚Äôs fundamental to reduce it, even on a small scale, and Just Before is created to help just with that, contributing to: 
* Cutting down methane, carbon emissions and overall pollution 
* Saving money by avoiding unnecessary purchases
* Supporting communities in need, particularly in low-income regions

The user's goal is clear: ‚Äúto consume everything **JUST BEFORE** it expires‚Äù

## Key features
With this idea in mind, I tried put myself in the users‚Äô shoes, to identify all the features I would have wanted the web-application to have, thus making it both functional and user-friendly.

Specifically, the priorities were:
* User registration, login, and logout
* Account management (view and update account details)
* Easy access to the list of products the user has already inserted, ordered by expiring date, to plan meals effectively
* Add new products with details (name, expiration date, quantity, unit)
* Search for products
* Update product information (e.g., quantity, unit, expiration date)
* Delete products once consumed or spoiled
  
The following sections describe the implementation in detail, explaining how the database is structured and analyzing each route and the corresponding html file.

### MYSQL DATABASE
The database consists of two main tables
* ‚Äúusers‚Äù, to store the users‚Äô information, including their username, email and password, which was previously hashed for safety reasons, and the id necessary to identify each user.
* ‚Äúproducts", to store products inserted by users, along with additional information including the expiring date, the quantity, and the unit of measurement.

To link correctly the two tables (so that, for instance, it is possible to know what products a specific user has inserted) the user-id is utilized as foreign key.

### INITIAL LAYOUT
It is a sort of blueprint for the other html files, extended by all other pages using Jinja. 

#### Head
It contains the meta tags, specific links copied from Favicon to add the Favicon icon created for the web application, the link to the css file and the title, containing the ninja block title to add additional text depending on what page the user is visiting.

#### Body 
##### NavBar
In the upper part there is a navbar (Bootstrap-based), which dynamically adapts its format depending on login status. Specifically, using the ninja syntax, if the field user_id of the flask session object is not None (meaning the user has logged in), the fields ‚ÄúAdd‚Äù, ‚ÄúSearch‚Äù, ‚ÄúDelete‚Äù, ‚ÄúChange‚Äù are shown on the left, while ‚ÄúAccount‚Äù and ‚ÄúLog Out‚Äù on the right. On the other hand, if the user has not logged in yet, ‚ÄúRegister‚Äù and ‚ÄúLog In‚Äù are displayed on the right.
##### Main section
The first element of the main part, shared by all pages, is a div with multiple colourful spans inside, used as a sort of background by putting its z-index in the css file equal to a negative value. 
Then there‚Äôs the main block jinja element to make the rest of the main different depending on the page visited by the user.
Hereafter, there is a part that is displayed, thanks to the if block provided by the ninja syntax, only if the user has not registered/logged in yet, since it‚Äôs aimed precisely at catching the user attention and convincing him of the importance of start using Just Before to reduce food waste, by displaying some statistics regarding how serious, problematic yet unfortunately common this phenomenon is. The data are organised by cards (from the bootstrap documentation), consisting of an image and a descriptive text, with some bolder and bigger titles in between.
The footer then reports the author's name.

### REGISTER
In the html file, a form allows the user to register by inserting his/her username, email and password. A confirmation for the password is also required.
At the end, there‚Äôs the ‚ÄúRegister‚Äù button the user needs to click to submit the form.

In the #register route the first if ‚Ä¶ else permits to distinguish two different blocks of code, depending on the request method. If it is GET, it means the user is visiting the page by clicking on ‚Äúregister‚Äù in the navbar, so the user should simply be rendered the register template. On the other end, the POST method is used when the user is submitting the data to register by click the homonymous button. Therefore, the input, previously saved in appropriate variables using request.form.get, must be checked first, returning an apology if:
* a field was omitted
* the password and its confirmation do not match.
Moreover, since the username and the email need to be unique, db.execute is used twice to get the list of usernames and emails respectively already in the database. Then each item of the two lists is compared to the corresponding value inserted by the user and, if they are equal, another apology is returned.
Otherwise, the password is hashed using the generate_password_hash function from Werkzeug documentation, and the data is inserted in the user table using db.execute.

### LOGIN
In the html, a form is used to make the user insert his/her username and password.
After clicking the login button, in the corresponding #login route, request.form.get is used to get the input and check whether it was left blank, returning an apology if so.
Then, db.execute is invoked to control if the username provided is in the database and if the password is correct, and if either of the two do not check out, another apology is returned.
Otherwise, the user‚Äôs id is saved in the corresponding field of the session object, before redirecting to the main page.

### LOGOUT
It simply clears the flask session and redirects the user to the main layout page.

### ACCOUNT
Thanks to account, the user is given the chance to modify the data he/she has inserted while registering.
In the upper part of the page, below the navbar, there‚Äôs a grey container with the current user data (username, email and password displayed as a sequence of asterisks).
Following, the form enables the user to change one or more fields by filling them out and clicking the ‚ÄúChange‚Äù button.
As usual, in the #account route, which is accessible only if users have previously logged in, the first if-else block permits to distinguish two different courses of action, depending on the request method: 
* If it is GET, it means the user is visiting the page by clicking on ‚Äúaccount‚Äù in the navbar so the page just needs to show the current account data and the form. Therefore, db.execute is used to select the information from the user table based on the session user id, and save them in a variable called userInfo, which is a list of dictionaries with actually just one element inside, which, in turn, is selected using the bracket notation and stored in a variable called displayInfo. However, the field containing the password is changed to a random number of asterisks since the password has been hashed and there‚Äôs no way back. Then, the render_template function is returned, passing the dictionary as an argument.
* On the other end, the POST method is used when the user is submitting the name of the product he/she wants to delete by click the homonymous button. Hence, request.form.get is used to obtain the user input. It‚Äôs relevant to notice though that the user is not obliged to provide a valid input for every field, since he/she could just want to change one or more specifications of the account but not all of them.
Consequently, for every field, the program checks whether it is not blank, and then, if so, runs some more controls (for example if the input has already been used when it comes to the new username or email, or if the new password and its confirmation match), rendering an apology in case of any error occurs. Contrarily, db.execute is invoked to update the user information on the table.
Lastly, the same lines of code as the GET block are used to show the updated user infos.

### INDEX
When the user is logged in, the main page doesn‚Äôt display the statistics about food waste (which were meant to show the user the importance of doing something concrete to reduce that serious appalling problem) but the list of products he/she has already inserted, to keep up visually with what he/she has to consume before it goes bad.
Therefore, using the Jinja 2 syntax iterating on every item of a list of dictionaries, ordered by expiring date and containing, for every product, its name, expiring date and quantity with the corresponding unit.
To make it more visually appealing, the information of each product is placed in a light grey container, and the name is bolded.

In the #index route, it‚Äôs not necessary to make distinctions based on the request method, since it‚Äôs only used to display the list of products inserted by the user.
In order to implement that, db.execute is used to select the data from the product table based on the user id, which is equal to the one saved in the session object created by flask. The return value is a list in which every argument is a dictionary containing the information requested about the products. Then, the for cycle iterates over each element of the list, calling the split method to format the expiring date correctly as year-month-date. Lastly, the render template, with the html page and the product list as arguments, is returned.

### ADD
In the html file add.html, the form, styled as a light gray container with a slightly wide border, allows the user can add products to his/her list, by indicating: 
* the name of the product
* the expiring date, using a specific date input so that the user is presented with a calendar, making the date selection more simple and visually intuitive
* the quantity, using a number input
* the unit of measurement, using a select menu with several options, covering possibly all the units widely used in the world.
At the end, the ‚ÄúAdd‚Äù button enables the user to submit the form.

In the #add route, which is accessible only if users have previously logged in, the first if-else block permits to distinguish two different blocks of code, depending on the request method: 
* If it is GET, it means the user is visiting the page by clicking on ‚Äúadd‚Äù in the navbar, so the add template should be simply render
* the POST method is instead used when the user is submitting the informations by click the add button. Consequently, firstly the request.form.get() function must be used to get the data inserted by the user (the name of the product, its expiring date, the quantity and the measurement unit) and store them in the appropriate variables.

However, it is also important to check the inputs, rendering an apology (more on that later) if they were left blank. Moreover, the expiring date is required not to be prior to today‚Äôs date. In order to compare them, the inserted expiring date, whose type was string, had to be converted into am actual date. Therefore, a variable (symbolically called dateObject) was created by using the strptime method from the datetime library. It indeed takes two arguments, the string that has to be covered, and a format code (in this case %Y-%m-%d), and returns a date time object. Then, the today() method is used to get the current date. Eventually the two were compared, returning an apology if today was bigger than the expiring date.
If not the case, db.execute is used to insert into the product table the data in the correct column, and the user is rended the add template again, so that he/she can add more products if needed.

### SEARCH
The aim is to enable the user to search products based on their names, which could be useful if the user wants to verify he/she has a specific product or ingredient in his/her list. This is achieved by means of a search bar, whose type is text, where the user can type in the name of the product he/she is looking for, followed by a button to submit it. 
Below, results are then displayed using jinja 2 syntax. In fact, if the variable passed as argument to the render_template function, called ‚Äúcompatibles‚Äù, is not None, every element of ‚Äúcompatibles‚Äù is shown, using a for loop, in a grey container.

In the #search route, which is accessible only if users have previously logged in, the first if-else, as always, permits to distinguish two different blocks of code, depending on the request method:
* If it is GET, it means the user is visiting the page by clicking on ‚Äúsearch‚Äù in the navbar so the page just needs to show the search bar by returning the render_template function without any additional parameter.
* On the other end, the POST method is used when the user is submitting the name of the product he/she wants to search for by click the homonymous button.
Hence, request.form.get is used to get the search name and store it in a variable symbolically called searchedProduct, returning an apology if the field is left blank. Then, a list called compatibles is declared and db.execute is used to select from the table ‚Äúproducts‚Äù all the products inserted by the user id currently saved in the session object, ordered by expiring date, stored in another variable called productsList.Following, inside a for loop iterating on every item of productsList, an if construct checks whether the searched product string is contained in the item name (which is a string itself). If so, db.execute is used to get all the information about that product and, after conveniently formatting the date, they are added to the ‚Äúcompatibles‚Äù list. Eventually, the render_template function is returned, passing along the ‚Äúcompatibles‚Äù list as argument.

### MAKE CHANGES
The goal is to give the user the chance to modify the information regarding a product he/she has already inserted, by means of a from consisting of:
* a select menu, implemented with jinja syntax, using a for loop to display the names of products already added by the user
* three input fields, to specify if and what data the user want to change between the expiring date, the quantity and the unit (which can be chosen from a select menu)
* a button to click on in order to submit the changes
* a final div containing a message to notify the user if the operation was successful, which, thanks to the jinja if block, appears only after the database has been updated correctly

In the corresponding #change route, which is accessible only if users have previously logged in, the current user id (specified in the session object) is saved in an homonymous variable and db.execute is used to create a list containing all the names of products inserted by the user with such user id. The first if-else block permits to distinguish two different blocks of code, depending on the request method:
* If it is GET, it means the user is visiting the page by clicking on ‚Äúchange‚Äù in the navbar so it simply returns the render_template function, passing as arguments  the products list (so that it can be displayed on the webpage) and another variable called selected whose value is set to None (since it is need to display the success message).
* On the other end, the POST method is used when the user is submitting relevant data by click the ‚ÄúChange‚Äù button. Therefore the request.form.get method is used to get the selected product name and the new quantity, unit and expiring date. It‚Äôs important to bear in mind that the user is free to change as many fields as he/she wants regarding the product, reason why the following if constructs check on whether the inputs are not blank, without returning any apology if they are though. The only exemption is the product name, which obviously needs to be selected. Hence, for every field that was not left blank, the corresponding row in the ‚Äúproducts‚Äù table is updated. Eventually the render_template function is returned, passing as arguments the products list (so that it can be displayed on the webpage) and another variable called selected whose value, this time, is the name of the selected product.
Another needed observation is that, unlike in other routes, the productsNames variable is declared and initialised outside the if-else construct and then used in both code blocks. That‚Äôs because the list of products among which the user can choose remains the same, regardless of the request method, since the user can always change data about products which he/she has already modified.

### DELETE PRODUCTS
It allows the user to delete a product from the list when needed, by simply selecting the name in the html page. In fact, using the jinja 2 syntax, products name are presented in alphabetical order as options of a select element, thus making it easier to find and recognise them.
After clicking the delete button, if everything goes well, the user is sent a message of success, thanks to the if block that checks if the value of ‚Äúselected‚Äù (passed as a parameter to the render template function) is equal to None, and, if not, displays the message.

As usual, in the #delete route, which is accessible only if users have previously logged in, the first if-else permits to distinguish two different blocks of code, depending on the request method:
* If it is GET, it means the user is visiting the page by clicking on ‚Äúdelete‚Äù in the navbar, so the user should simply be rendered the delete template. Since the html page consists of a select menu whose options are the products‚Äô name in the database, db.execute is used to select them from the ‚Äúproducts‚Äù table. The list, stored in a variable called productsName, is sent as a parameter of the render_template function, along with another variable, selected, which is assigned as equal to None, so that any success message is not displayed.
* On the other end, the POST method is used when the user is submitting the name of the product he/she wants to delete by click the homonymous button. If so, request.form.get is used to get the name, storing it in a variable called selected. The input is then checked to be sure the user has actually selected an option from the menu. In such case, db.execute is called to delete the product form the table.
  
Afterwards, db.execute is used again to select the products name, which are eventually sent as a parameter of the render_template function, along with selected, so that the success message can be shown and the user can delete other products if he/she wants to.
The second last line may seem repetitive, since it is used also when the request method is GET, and an observer might think it would have the code shorter to just place the command before, outside the if-else construct. However, that actually would not have worked, because, once the user has deleted a product, it must not be displayed again as an option in the select menu.

### IN HELPERS.PY
There are two functions:
* apology, sending an error message and picturing Boo from Monsters & Co, as a fun indication of something gong wrong
* login_required, which I took from ‚ÄúFinance‚Äù as well


### STATIC FOLDER
In the static folder, there are all the images used throughout the website and style.css, in which the elements of the website are added some styling adjustments, in place of the bootstrap default ones, with the aim of making the website ‚Äúminimal‚Äù but visually captivating at the same time. Hence the use of pastel colours for the background and bold and bigger fonts for titles and other important information were chosen.
